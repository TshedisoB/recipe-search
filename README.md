## Overview

The project entails developing a Recipe Search user interface using React and Redux Thunks to manage asynchronous API calls effectively. It includes adding a 'Search' button to initiate recipe searches, utilizing Redux Thunk to access the API asynchronously upon button click. The web application displays each recipe's name, ingredients, and picture in a visually appealing manner once the search results arrive.
